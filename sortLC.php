#
#  sortLC.php : 2 PHP functions to sort Library of Congress (LC) call numbers
#
#  Version: 0.1 alpha (as in untested)
#
#  Ported and adapted for PHP by Ken Irwin, kirwin@wittenberg.edu
#  Based on sortLC.pl (version 1.2) by Michael Doran, doran@uta.edu
#        University of Texas at Arlington Libraries
#        Box 19497, Arlington, TX 76019, USA
#
#
#  Usage:
#    This file contains two functions: SortLC() and NormalizeLC()
#    SortLC() uses NormalizeLC(). To make use of this functionality from
#    within a PHP script, first establish an array of call numbers 
#    or an associative array in which the call number is the key.
#   
#    For a simple array, use the usort() function to sort by call number, e.g.:
#      
#      usort($array, "SortLC");
#
#    For an associative array, use the uksort() function to sort, e.g.:
# 
#      uksort($array, "SortLC");
#    
#
#    Unparsable call numbers are sorted to the beginning of the array.
#
#    Identical call numbers are NOT deduped, although some de-duplication
#    can be accomplished by using the array_unique() function in the main
#    script from which these functions are called, however this only dedups 
#    exactly identical call number strings. If two call numbers are 
#    functionally the same but are differently-spaced or punctuated, they 
#    will be treated as two separate call numbers by the array_unique()
#    function.
#
#
#  Disclaimer: This application relies on an LC call number
#              normalization routine for sorting. The normalization
#              routine is far from perfect, therefore the sorted
#              output will also be imperfect.
#
#  Known flaws: 
#        * Except for copy, vol, etc numbers, sorting may break down after 
#          second set of cutter numbers.
#
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#
#  Significant differences between original Perl script and this PHP version:
#        * This version attempts to sort some of the post-cutter information,
#          including issue, volume, part, binding, and disc numbers.
#          This feature will hopefully appear in future versions of sortLC.pl
#        * This PHP version is intended for use with PHP's user-defined 
#          sort commands: usort() and uksort(), whereas sortLC.pl is
#          usable as a standalone script for sort a file full of call numbers.
#          See "Usage" section above.
