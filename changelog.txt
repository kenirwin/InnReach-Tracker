Changes in version 1.1.2 - 6 August 2015:

* changed upload folder to one outside InnReachTracker folder
* NOTE: if upgrading to this version you will need to define an $Upload_Folder in your config.php file
* updated documentation

Changes in version 1.1.1:

* re-added link to jQuery library

Changes in version 1.1.0:

* discontinued use of deprecated PHP functions session_register(), etc.
* suitable for use with PHP 4.1.0+
* necessary for use with PHP 5.4.0+

Changes in version 1.0.2e:

* fixed incompatibility with Firefox 4.0+

Changes in version 1.0.2d:

* adds functionality: highlights table rows on-click

Changes in version 1.0.2c:

* fixes an installation bug and a few typos
* better support and explanation of the built-in data upload function
* faster search of circ-history-by-call # using PHP array_intersect()
* faster pcirc_holdings.php (local holdings add) using stats table
* improved documentation!

Changes in version 1.0.2b:

* change mysql query in scripts.php line 46 to correctly cue the user to 
  update the stats table each month. It's not as good as it could be, but 
  it's better than the non-functionality of 1.0.2a.

Changes in version 1.0.2a:

* supports limiting to circs by a particular patron type (PTYPE)
  * ceases to use innreach_stats table, replaced by innreach_stats_by_ptype

* better implementation of return-to-previous-screen functionality after adding titles 
  * uses new $_SESSION[last_query] cookie

* added subject descriptions of LC classes

* better handling and display of limiting by month / date-range
  * show currently-selected month if current page is limited by month
  * else, show "unselected" if this option is not in effect

* user can remove date & ptype limits w/ "x" links at top of page

* upload-data page -- easy for non-MySQL-savvy users
  * uses new page: upload_data.php
  * ugly but functional
  * default config setting enables this function
  * to disable, set: $allow_uploads = false; in config.php

* corrected date display to reflect truth, and total # of months

* make circ history available for all books (title known or not) w/o AJAX
  * opens in new window, could be classier, but it works
  * links from the # of circs column in ShowBooksByQuery()
_________________________

Enhancements for future versions:

* run reports on specific date ranges

* the "up-to-date" check (scripts.php, ca. line 38) assumes that the most 
  recent month is the only place there could be a discrepancy between raw 
  data and the stats table. is there a better metric?
